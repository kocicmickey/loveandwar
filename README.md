# LOVEANDWAR - Love and War, a game engine where all is fair

This is a game engine under development. It will resolve both combat and affection using the same resolution framework, and the resolution mechanism in any specific case of combat or affection will belong to one of the participants.

# Features

- Game engines tend to be focused on combat mechanics. The mechanics of this game will be for both combat and affection--both war and love. Moreover, the war mechanics and the love mechanics will be the same mechanics!

- In any given combat or instance of love, the use of the mechanics will belong to one of the combatants/lovers who are involved. This will have implications for engine design that are still being developed.
